Music Preference Prediction Model.

This project implements a machine learning model that predicts users' music preferences based on their age and gender. The model was built using a Decision Tree algorithm and developed in a Jupyter Notebook environment with the Scikit-learn library.

Project Highlights:
Dataset: Sourced from Kaggle, containing users' demographic information and music preferences.

Algorithm: Utilised Decision Tree to classify and predict music preferences.

Application: Designed to recommend music to new users after signing into a music application.
